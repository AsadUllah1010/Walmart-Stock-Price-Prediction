# Walmart-Stock-Price-Prediction
This project is based on Walmart stock price prediction using ARIMA &amp; SARIMA.
# Introduction
Stock price prediction is a crucial yet complex task in the financial sector, where accurate forecasting can significantly impact investment decisions and risk management. In this project, we develop a data science model specifically aimed at predicting the stock price of Walmart Inc., one of the world’s largest retail corporations. Leveraging historical stock price data, market indicators, and statistical techniques, the model seeks to understand trends and patterns that influence Walmart’s stock performance. The project integrates machine learning algorithms and time series analysis to generate reliable predictions that can aid investors, analysts, and retail strategists.

Our approach involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of predictive models such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM neural networks. The model also evaluates the impact of external variables such as trading volume and macroeconomic trends. This multifaceted analysis enables a deeper understanding of Walmart’s stock behavior over time. By exploring both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, the model aims to provide valuable insights for anticipating future price movements with greater accuracy and confidence.

# Conclusion
The Walmart Stock Price Prediction model demonstrates the potential of data science in transforming financial forecasting into a more data-driven and systematic process. Through the use of robust statistical methods and machine learning techniques, the model effectively captures underlying patterns in historical stock data. The results indicate that with the right combination of data inputs and algorithmic models, it is possible to make informed predictions about future stock performance, even in the face of market volatility.

While the model shows promising accuracy, it is important to acknowledge its limitations, such as sensitivity to unseen market events and external shocks that are hard to quantify. Future improvements could include integrating sentiment analysis from financial news and social media or applying ensemble learning methods to enhance prediction robustness. Overall, this project reinforces the relevance of data science in financial analytics and opens the door for more advanced applications in stock market forecasting.
